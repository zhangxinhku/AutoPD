# AutoPD
AutoPD is an automatic biological macromolecular crystallography data processing and structure determination pipeline for high-performance synchrotron radiation sources and academic users. Requiring only diffraction data and a sequence file for input, this pipeline efficiently generates high-precision structural models.
